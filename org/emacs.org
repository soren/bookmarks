* About Emacs

  [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs][Emacs]] is a family of text editors with the first version developed
  in the mid-1970s. I'm using *[[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][GNU Emacs]]* that is free software and
  the most widely used variant. The core Emacs functionality can be
  extended and highly customized using [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/][Emacs Lisp]]. Emacs works both in
  a graphical desktop environment and in a text-based terminal.
